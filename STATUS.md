  ]
}
```

### Animation Lifecycle
1. **Capture**: Extract current layer states from DOM
2. **Storage**: Save to server with UUID generation
3. **Sharing**: Generate URL with favorite parameter
4. **Restoration**: Recreate exact visual state
5. **Continuation**: Transition back to normal generation

## 🎯 User Experience

### Save Workflow
1. Click heart button (♥) or press F key
2. System captures current painting state
3. Success toast appears with confirmation
4. Favorite is saved to server with UUID

### Gallery Workflow

2. Modal opens showing all saved favorites with thumbnails
3. Click any favorite to load it instantly
4. Click red × button to delete (with confirmation)
5. Close modal with X or click outside

### Load Workflow
1. Open URL with `?favorite=<uuid>` parameter
2. Favorite loads in ~500ms
3. Images fade in with saved opacity/transformations
4. Staggered fade-out begins (3s intervals)

## 🆕 Latest Updates (Enhanced Favorites & Timing System)

### Major Improvements
- **Background Color Persistence**: Favorites now save and restore background color (black/white)
  - Captures current background state when saving favorites
  - Automatically switches to correct background when loading favorites
  - Ensures complete visual fidelity of saved painting moments

- **Improved Favorite Loading Experience**: Fixed visual glitches during favorite restoration
  - **Immediate Layer Clearing**: No more brief visibility of old images during loading
  - **Smart Pattern Timing**: New layers start appearing at 1.5s while favorites are still fading
  - **Config-Based Fade Timing**: Uses configuration values for natural, customizable transitions

### Enhanced Fade-Out System
- **Config-Driven Timing**: Favorite layers now use configuration values for realistic fade-outs
  - Hold time: Random between `minHoldTimeSec` and `maxHoldTimeSec`, then divided by 2
  - Fade-out time: Random between `fadeOutMinSec` and `fadeOutMaxSec` (full duration)
  - Example: 2.5-6s hold, 15-60s fade-out (with default config)

- **Overlapping Transitions**: Extended fade-out times create rich layering effects
  - New generative layers appear while favorites are still fading
  - Creates beautiful compositional overlaps lasting 15-60+ seconds
  - Much more natural transition back to normal generation

### Bug Fixes
- **Favorites Opacity Fix**: Fixed critical issue where favorites were saving final opacity (100%) instead of current animated opacity values
  - Now uses `getComputedStyle()` to capture real-time animated opacity during fade-in/fade-out transitions
  - Ensures saved favorites accurately reproduce the exact visual state at moment of saving

### UI Polish
- **Toast Message Cleanup**: Removed "successfully" from all notifications for cleaner feedback
- **ESC Key Support**: Added ESC key to close favorites modal for better accessibility

### Previous Updates (Favorites Gallery Enhancement)

#### Features Added
- **Favorites Gallery Modal**: Complete visual interface for browsing saved favorites
- **Thumbnail System**: Shows actual layered image previews with transformations
- **Enhanced API**: Added GET `/api/favorites` endpoint for listing all favorites
- **Delete Functionality**: Red × buttons with confirmation dialogs
- **Keyboard Navigation**: G key opens the gallery modal
- **Responsive Grid**: 2-5 column layout adapting to screen size
- **Loading States**: Proper feedback during gallery operations

#### Technical Improvements
- **Event Handling**: Resolved delete button conflicts with load actions
- **Image Preview System**: Accesses ImageManager data for actual thumbnails
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate FavoritesGallery manager component
- **Memory Efficient**: Thumbnails use scaled-down transforms and cached images
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of missing or corrupted favorites

The system is now feature-complete and production-ready for both casual viewing and kiosk installations, with accurate state capture and a polished user experience.
