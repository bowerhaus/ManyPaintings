- ✅ Image discovery and metadata extraction
- ✅ API endpoints: `/`, `/kiosk`, `/health`, `/api/images`
- ✅ Error handling and caching headers
- ⏳ Pattern generation API (`/api/pattern/<seed>`) - placeholder only

### Frontend (JavaScript)
- ✅ **ImageManager** - Catalog loading, image preloading, memory management
- ✅ **AnimationEngine** - Advanced layer animation with speed-responsive timing

- ✅ **Pattern Management** - Pattern codes display and update automatically
- ✅ **Center-based Transformations** - Proper scaling, rotation, and translation
- ✅ **Memory Optimization** - Dynamic layer management prevents overload
- ✅ **Performance Optimization** - Speed affects all timings, not just spawn rate
- ✅ **Responsive UI** - Consolidated bottom-center control panel with mouse activation
- ✅ **Background Themes** - Black/white backgrounds with adaptive UI and blend modes
- ✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Space (play/pause), N (new pattern), B (background toggle)

## 🚧 Known Limitations & TODOs

### Remaining Issues
- [ ] Pattern generation could be enhanced with server-side algorithms
- [ ] Memory management needs testing with 1000+ images
- [ ] No production deployment scripts
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing needed

### Performance Concerns
- [ ] Not tested with 1000+ images yet
- [ ] Raspberry Pi performance optimization pending
- [ ] Browser memory limits not validated
- [ ] Image preloading queue optimization needed

## 📋 Next Development Phase

### Phase 2: Backend API Development (NEXT)
**Priority Tasks:**
1. **Pattern Generation System** 
   - Implement server-side deterministic pattern generation
   - Create pattern algorithms that use image metadata
   - Add pattern validation and reproducibility testing

2. **Enhanced Image Management**
   - Add image categorization/tagging system
   - Implement smart preloading based on pattern predictions
   - Add image loading performance metrics

3. **Static File Optimization**
   - Configure proper cache headers for images
   - Add compression for API responses
   - Implement conditional requests (304 Not Modified)

### Phase 3: Animation Engine Enhancement
**Upcoming Tasks:**
- Pattern-based animation control integration
- Performance optimization for continuous operation
- Frame dropping for low-performance devices
- GPU-accelerated CSS transforms validation
